For sliced potatoes: Thinly slice potatoes about 1/8 inch thick. (Quick tip: If you have one, use a mandoline or vegetable slicer to slice the potatoes.) In a large skillet melt butter or margarine (use about 1 tablespoon for each medium potato) over medium heat. Add potato slices and cook, covered, for 8 minutes, turning occasionally. Uncover; cook for 12 to 15 minutes more or until potatoes are tender and light brown, turning occasionally. If necessary, you may need to add additional butter during cooking.
